<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>As a DME Claims Tier 2 CSR, you will receive calls about redeterminations for Original Medicare claims. If a redetermination is still unresolved after more than 60 calendar days, escalate it to the DME MAC for resolution.</p>
<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<p>After completing this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify the status of redeterminations in Next Generation Desktop (NGD).</li>
<li>Determine if an escalation is necessary and identify the information needed to escalate the issue.</li>
<li>Escalate issues to the appropriate DME MAC.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Conditions for Redeterminations and Appeals</h2>
<p>A beneficiary has the right to appeal when they disagree with a coverage or payment decision that Medicare has made. In most cases, the DME MAC responds to the redetermination request by mail within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. If the redetermination is unresolved after 60 calendar days, a Claims Tier 1 CSR transfers the call to you.</p>
<p>You escalate the issue to the DME MAC if all 4 of the following conditions are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>The beneficiary has already submitted a written appeal.</li>
<li>The redetermination or appeal decision is not showing in <acronym title="Next Generation Desktop">NGD</acronym>.</li>
<li>The status of the original claim (for example, adjustment or reopening) has not changed.</li>
<li>It has been more than 60 calendar days since the appeal was submitted.</li>
</ol>
